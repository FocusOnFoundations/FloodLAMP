Take the samples off the amp heater. Take a photo to read the color to determine the test result. 

### description

Once the amplification reaction heat step is finished, the samples are put into a lightbox and a photo is taken with a smartphone. A change in the liquid color from pink to yellow indicates the target (SARS-CoV-2 virus) is present.

Okay, timer is almost done here. Samples are about to come off. My phone timer went off. So I'm at the ready here. Okay, and we want to be tight on that. Here we go. That is what you want to see. Just positive control positive and everything else negative, assuming you're testing your friends and coworkers. So here we did the amp heat reactions. And now log and report results. Let the samples cool for at least a minute. As they cool, the color brightens up a little bit. So again, we'll give this a minute. So to go through the checklist here, when we set this timer, we set a phone timer for 24 minutes. Then we did a second thing, which was put the samples in the fridge. So you want to make sure that you do those two items. The reason the samples go in the fridge is so that if you need to do a rerun, they're preserved. So, important step. Okay, it's been about a minute. So the way we do this, you can do this on an Android or iPhone. If you have a different camera, you'll just have to get the right filter. Take a photo. You can either zoom in on your phone or afterwards. And then we do, if you have an iPhone, we apply the second filter over, it's called Vivid. We'll crop it a little bit more. Okay. There we go. And so now that's done.
