When the reactions go onto the amp heater, set your main timer for 25 minutes and then also set the phone timer for 24 minutes. Then put the sample tubes in the fridge.

### description

This shows the sample intake step which involves scanning the QR codes on the sample tubes with the FloodLAMP Mobile App.

Okay, so we just got our samples on the amp. Our main timer is going over there. So we're going to make sure we do these two parts circled here. Set the phone timer for 24 minutes or however long you need as your buffer to get back, because typically you go do something during this time. The second one is to put the sample tubes in the fridge, but notice here we have the intake sample tubes in the app as well. So we're just gonna go ahead and intake the sample tubes in the app. Here we go, give just a sec. Okay. So pop open the FloodLAMP app. And I'm already logged in on the staff side. If you're not, you switch there. So now we just hit intake, and hit create batch, and that's the batch name. Now notice that this needs to go over here. It's up at the top because you can do it first, but we typically are waiting now until it's on the app to save some time. And it's the date backwards, dash one for the first one. Okay, so we hit submit. And now it just pops straight into the scanner, and we're going to keep these in order. It doesn't like the lighting here. There we go. For some reason it doesn't pick it up for you, usually it helps by moving it back. It's kind of a little counterintuitive there. Okay, so now hit cancel. And now if you wanna linearly process them through, choose your batch, update it, tell it it's on the amp. There you go. And now once it comes off and you're ready to result it, you go into that one, hit update, hit result, and you can result them. If for some reason one of the tubes is positive or inconclusive and you want to result the rest of the batch is negative, you can hit this arrow and you can go scan it. Well, this would be I think to add to the to that batch what we could do is go up to the scanner here and hit no batch. Say this one was positive. We could scan it. There you go. I notice now it pulled that one out of the batch. I think if we do this, I believe, we can add it right back in. So that allows you to flexibly process all the samples together, which typically they're going to be negative. Well, not so much right now, unfortunately, but when you're doing routine screening. And then the few positives that you do get, you can pull out easily. And the result of the rest is negative, and the positive is positive. So we're going to make sure to remember our key step here, get these guys in the fridge. There we go. Thanks for watching!
