Now, he's ready to pipette into. So get this stuff out of the way, get your two microliter pipette, and get comfortable. It's going to take about 30 minutes to pipette a plate. But just keep in mind that you are testing about 400 people trying to find that needle in a haystack of unknown infected person before they spread it. That's the whole goal here. So as you're getting bored doing this, remind yourself that. So I'm a little bit cramped on space here. Let's see. I'm just gonna Let's see, I'm gonna just get some stuff out of the way that I'm not gonna be using. So I would move these guys probably. Yikes. These guys probably. Yikes. So we're just gonna want to draw. Probably have them end up set up like this. And then again you're going to come here you would have dispensed probably into a like a 1.5 mill tube, one ml of the inactivation solution that you used for adding to the samples. And so you would do that guy first, again in position number two. I think in the last video I forgot to show doing that positive control so but showed that on the first one so so this would be position number two right there I'm sorry that's position B1 okay then you get that guy back out of the way. Now that gives you a reference point to start. And again, I would go ahead and set up your pipette tips. In this case, you probably have a new box and it would have them going all the way across and you just would have taken out the second one. So it would look like this except going all the way across. So now we're ready to get comfortable and start pipetting. I don't know if there's any liquid in here. So the key here is getting sorted out on your lookup. So you make sure that this goes in the right spot. And notice we got our batch label on here, and then we can, ideally these batch labels will be smaller labels, and you can put this on the plate or make sure it rides along with the plate. Okay, so you get the idea here. Making sure you're lined up tip to spoil spot. You're going all the way down to the bottom, doing your five pipette up and downs, and then above the liquid blowout and tip touch. There you go. So you just keep going. So you just keep going. Then, once you finish, so you go all the way across, then you get another plate seal. And you follow the same operation you did before. You peel this one back and you put it across and you seal the whole plate back up. Make sure to do your positive control last here, same way we did it before. Okay, that is how you do a plate.
