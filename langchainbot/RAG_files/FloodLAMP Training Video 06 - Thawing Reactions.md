Okay, so while these guys are cooling for the five minutes, we're gonna get out our reaction strips here. We got three left from this batch. You're gonna wanna make sure you don't leave these out for too long. Make sure you keep the freezer door shut while you do this. So these guys just take just about five minutes. Now here's a tip, push them up from the bottom. There you go. Make sure that they're all nice and pink there. If they're not pink that means you've probably got a little air gap on the top seal and you can't use that tube. So here we go. Just going to leave those. Make sure to get these guys back in the freezer before they thaw. There we go. Oh, got our five minute timer again. Stop that guy. Okay. Because we're only doing one strip, we're not going to use the cold block. Because we're going to be able to load this guy and get him on the amp pretty quick. If you were going to do more strips, then even before now, when you get him on the amp heater, you would get out your cold block. Here's the cold block. Because you want the cold block to warm up just a little bit. You don't want it to be totally frozen so that when you put the reactor strips in it they you want to stay cold but not frozen. OK. In terms of our run sheet here, there's where we're at. We're using strip eight tubes. They are frozen. And the reaction mix ID was on there. I can also get it from when I made it. Let's show you what that looks like. Here it is. So it's RM0115-1. I made this just a few days ago and I made all six strips. So that means six strips. I can say two strips left.
