## CONTAMINATION INFRACTIONS

PPE lapse/removal
Use green labeled pen/marker with bare hands and not putting it to be cleaned afterwards
Use unmarked pen/marker with clean gloves (without cleaning gloves after or changing gloves)
Bare hands on anything improper, except in desk area
Reuse pipette tip improperly
Touch pipette tip to anything and then not discard it
Touch anything dirty then go back to work (face, mask, uncleaned phone, uncleaned laptop)

## NOTE

It is recommended that 1XISS and Reaction Mix be prepared before the assay run (instructions below).

## DOCUMENTATION

Check off each item after completing it
Write legibly

## GLOSSARY OF TERMS

100XIS………………………….. 100-fold concentrated Inactivation Solution
1XISS……………………………. 1X Inactivation Saline Solution
PGS………………………………. Primer Guanidine Solution
CLAMP MM…………………. Colorimetric Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Master Mix
RM………………………………… Reaction Mix (CLAMP MM and PGS)
TPC………………………………. Twist Positive Control

## 1XISS PREP

Record volumes of saline & 100XIS in 1XISS Prep form prior to pipetting
Combine saline and 100XIS in a 50mL falcon tube or 30mL Chub tube, depending on volume
Vortex 30 seconds
Label tube with 1XISS ID (e.g., “1X_MMDD-1”) and record the same ID into the 1XISS Prep Form and the table on this form

Sample Batch ID (from App):
Inactiv Heater:
1X Inactiv Saline Soln ID:
Dispense: Pipette or Manual Disp or Electric Disp

## INACTIVATION

Add 1mL of 1XISS to each sample tube
Verify that tubes are properly sealed afterward (i.e., not cross-threaded)
Vortex 10 sec (if individual tubes) or 30 sec (if tubes-in-rack)
Heat 8 min in Water Bath (set to 99°C)
Cool 10 min
Put in refrigerator before 30 minute mark

## REACTION MIX PREP

Complete the entry in the RM Prep Form prior to pipetting
Calc volumes correctly for PGS and CLAMP based on number of reactions
Remove CLAMP MM and PGS from freezer to thaw, but do not allow them to warm
Briefly spin down reagent tubes (removes reagent from the cap and tube walls)
Pipette CLAMP MM and PGS into a 1.5mL tube using calculated volumes
Promptly return PGS and CLAMP source tubes to freezer
Vortex and spin down the RM tube
Aliquot 23uL of RM into each reaction tube (plate or strips-of-8)
Pipetting at the bottom of tubes
No blowout while dispensing reaction mix (to prevent bubbles in bottom of well)
Visually check the volumes in each reaction tube (that they appear to be even)
If using a plate, cover filled tubes with rack lid to prevent dust
At this stage, RM reaction tubes can be capped and placed in the freezer for storage if they are not to be used fresh.

## AMPLIFICATION REACTION

Remove PCR cold block from freezer ~10 min before adding tubes
Prep RM plate/strips (thawed, not warm)
Set up tips to align with reactions
Use a lookup rack to keep track of sample order
Tip layout aligns with arrangement of sample tubes in lookup rack & aligns with layout of reaction plate/strips
Add negative control first (2uL 1XISS)
Add 2uL of each inactivated sample to reaction tubes, visually checking the volume in the tip each time. Pipette up & down 5X, blow out in liquid, tip touch.

With each add, verify the correct position (tip vs sample tube vs reaction tube)
Transfer plate/strip to PCR rack (not cold block - rxns don’t go to amp cold)
Retrieve TPC from freezer, touching only with one hand (consider this hand dirty)
Add 2uL TPC to pos. ctrl, return TPC to freezer (IMMEDIATELY change glove)
Cap reaction tubes / seal plate
Change gloves again after loading tubes/plate onto amp heater
Set main timer for 25 min
Set secondary timer for 24 min
Put sample tubes in fridge
Remove rxns from amp promptly, wait 1 minute before imaging
Take photo in lightbox
For photo apply crop and ‘Vivid’ filter (or increase saturation 70% for android)
