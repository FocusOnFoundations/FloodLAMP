However, in general laboratory practice, whether to blow out with a pipette depends on the type of pipette tip being used and the protocol specified for the particular assay or reagent.\n\nPipette tips can be either \"positive displacement\" or \"air displacement.\" For air displacement pipettes, there are two types of tips: \"pre-rinsed\" or \"standard.\" With pre-rinsed tips, you typically do not need to blow out because the tip is designed to dispense the correct volume without the need for blowing out. With standard tips, you might need to blow out to ensure the complete delivery of the liquid, but this is not always recommended because it can lead to aerosol generation, which could be a source of contamination, especially in sensitive assays like the FloodLAMP QuickColor test.\n\nIn the context of the FloodLAMP QuickColor test, the primary concern seems to be avoiding contamination and ensuring the integrity of the test components. Blowing out could potentially introduce contaminants or aerosols that could compromise the test results. Therefore, it is essential to follow the specific protocol for the test, which would likely prioritize accuracy and contamination prevention over the concern of minimal reagent loss."

Well, the positive controls won't work.

So what are we going to do to avoid the RNAs is, number one, is access control. And I sort of already saw some of this going on.

The safety procedures listed include a lab coat, gloves, face mask, and face shield or goggles. However, it is important to note that while hair nets are not mentioned in this specific context, they are commonly used in laboratory settings to prevent contamination from human hair. If the protocol being followed is concerned with preventing RNA degradation and contamination, as suggested by the mention of RNases and the precautions against them, it would be prudent to use a hair net to minimize the risk of contamination from human skin and hair. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, a hair net could be considered good laboratory practice in this context, especially when working with sensitive assays like the FloodLAMP QuickColor test."

Always wear gloves in the lab and change them often, especially after contact with skin, hair, doorknobs, keyboards, or animals. Use RNAs-free solutions and RNAs-free certified disposable plasticware and filter tips. Maintain a separate area for RNA work and carefully clean the surfaces.

Well, the positive controls won't work. And so another key thing that makes us able to do this test in this kind of environment with newly trained firefighters is the controls, when you use them properly and when you design the test to use the controls, give you a great indication of when the test is working and when it's not. So what are we going to do to avoid the RNAs is, number one, is access control. And I sort of already saw some of this going on.

I'm Randy True with FolodLAMP Biotechnologies, and this is the FloodLAMP testing training program for our QuickColor test. This is a visually read colorimetric LAMP test that can take as little as about 15 minutes of hands-on time to run, and has high sensitivity, molecular quality. This is a great screening test and we're going to be running it here in this setup and the training program is going to cover all the mechanics and the tips and tricks for doing all the steps. We're going to be going through both the steps as well as the run sheets and the way that we log these runs, which are a key part of our quality system. So stay tuned.

You may need to zoom in on your phone or adjust the camera angle to get a clear image.\n\n3. **Applying Filters**: If you are using an iPhone, apply a second filter called \"Vivid\" to enhance the image quality.\n\n4. **Cropping**: Crop the image a bit more to focus on the relevant area of the test result.\n\nThese steps are necessary to ensure that the image of the test result is clear and that the colors are vivid enough to be accurately analyzed.

You know, labs typically have biosafety cabinets or chem hoods. Those are good places to do it. So there's a sort of a few options here, but I think it is important to highlight that this is the step to pay the most attention to is this very first step of opening the tube to add the inactivation solution. After that, it gets vortexed and heated, and then that it's a chemical plus heat inactivation, which denatures all the proteins and lysis the virus. And so it's not even a positive sample would not be infectious after that step. So in terms of chemical safety, I provided a link here to the SDSs involved with our test. And the two main chemicals are TSEP and EDTA, which are the two components of the main components of the inactivation solution. This inactivation solution is at two, You work with it at two concentrations, the 100x, which is what you use",

You don't want it to be totally frozen so that when you put the reactor strips in it they you want to stay cold but not frozen. OK. In terms of our run sheet here, there's where we're at. We're using strip eight tubes. They are frozen. And the reaction mix ID was on there. I can also get it from when I made it. Let's show you what that looks like. Here it is. So it's RM0115-1. I made this just a few days ago and I made all six strips. So that means six strips. I can say two strips left.",
