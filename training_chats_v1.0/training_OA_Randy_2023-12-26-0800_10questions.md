At what point should you put your inactivated samples in the fridge by?

You should put your inactivated samples in the refrigerator before the 30-minute mark after heating them for 8 minutes in a water bath set to 99°C and subsequently cooling for 10 minutes【9†source】.


You should always blow out with the pipette to prevent reagent loss. True or false and why?

The statement that one should always blow out with the pipette to prevent reagent loss is false. According to the protocol, you should not blow out while dispensing the reaction mix, as this is done to prevent bubbles in the bottom of the well, which could interfere with the accuracy of the assay by affecting the distribution of reagents and possibly impacting the detection of the COVID-19 virus【0†source】.


What control is added first?

The negative control is added first in the form of 2µL of 1X Inactivation Saline Solution (1XISS)【18†source】.


What is the difference between the 100XIS and the IXISS

The 100XIS is a 100-fold concentrated Inactivation Solution, whereas the 1XISS is a 1X Inactivation Saline Solution. The concentration difference implies that the 100XIS is a concentrated stock which likely needs to be diluted to create the 1XISS for use in the assay【23†source】.


Is it okay to use an unmarked pen with clean gloves?

It is not considered acceptable to use an unmarked pen with clean gloves without either cleaning the gloves after use or changing gloves. This is highlighted as a contamination infraction in the protocol, which indicates that particular care should be taken to maintain the cleanliness of gloves during the testing procedures【28†source】.


Is a hair net required PPE?

Based on the available documentation, a hair net is not explicitly listed as required Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for the flood lamp assay protocol. The listed PPE includes a lab coat, gloves, face mask, and face shield or goggles【0†source】. If additional information is needed or if policies have changed, it may be provided in other sections of the protocol or in an updated document.


How long does the amplification step take on the heater?

The amplification step on the heater takes 25 minutes. You should also set a secondary timer for 24 minutes, allowing you to prepare for the next step that follows immediately after the amplification step is completed【3†source】.


What kind of processing do you need to do to your results image?

For the results image, you need to take a photo in a lightbox and then apply a crop and the ‘Vivid’ filter, or increase the saturation by 70% if you are using an Android device【41†source】.


What is the total volume of the reaction tube with the sample and reaction mix?

The total volume of the reaction tube with the sample and reaction mix is not explicitly stated in the sections of the document provided in the search results. Additional information within the document may be needed to determine the exact total volume. To ensure accuracy, please refer to the specific steps of the protocol that describe the volume of sample and reaction mix to be added to each tube, or if you prefer, I can continue searching the document with alternative queries.


Reaction Mix should be kept in the fridge for future use. True or False, explain.

The statement is true; Reaction Mix (RM) can be stored. At the stage where the RM reaction tubes are ready, they can be capped and placed in the freezer for storage if they are not to be used immediately【50†source】. This suggests that the Reaction Mix can be preserved for future use, given proper storage conditions.
